# Caravan
Student project game utilizing the accelerometer to move the caravan as the player attempts to avoid obstacles and progress through each level. 
After Update 0.9 the game was transfered to iPhone development and that code is not on GitHub. The game was complete aside from art and sound (and levels of polish) and subsequently abandoned at the end of the spring semester.
